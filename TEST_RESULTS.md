## Failed Tests (11)

### 1. HTTP 500 Errors (9 tests) ❌

**Issue:** Server throws unhandled exceptions and returns HTTP 500 instead of proper JSON error responses.

**Expected Behavior:** Return `{ error: { code: X, message: "..." }, isCompleted: true }` in JSON format
**Actual Behavior:** Server crashes with HTTP 500 and HTML error page

#### Rollback Operations (2 failures)

| Test | Error | Root Cause |
|------|-------|------------|
| `should fail when rolling back already released hold` | HTTP 500 | No check if hold was already released |
| `should fail when rolling back already redeemed hold` | HTTP 500 | No check if hold was already redeemed |

#### Double Operation Prevention (3 failures)

| Test | Error | Root Cause |
|------|-------|------------|
| `should fail when trying to release twice` | HTTP 500 | No idempotency check on release |
| `should fail when trying to redeem twice` | HTTP 500 | No idempotency check on redeem |
| `should fail when trying to rollback twice` | HTTP 500 | No idempotency check on rollback |

#### Invalid Operation ID Tests (3 failures)

| Test | Error | Root Cause |
|------|-------|------------|
| `should fail release with non-existent operationId` | HTTP 500 | No validation that operationId exists |
| `should fail redeem with non-existent operationId` | HTTP 500 | No validation that operationId exists |
| `should fail redeem with mismatched operationId` | HTTP 500 | No validation of operationId match |



### 2. Missing Validation (2 tests) ❌

**Issue:** Server lacks business logic validation and allows invalid operations.

**Expected Behavior:** Operations should fail with proper error messages
**Actual Behavior:** Operations succeed when they shouldn't

| Test | Expected | Actual | Root Cause |
|------|----|--------|------------|
| `should not allow operations on non-existent asset` | | No validation that asset exists before issuing tokens |
| `should fail when releasing with wrong source` | `error.isDefined()` | `error = undefined` | No validation of operation ownership |

## Passed Tests (7) ✅

| Category | Test | Status |x
|----------|------|--------|
| Rollback Operations | `should rollback held funds and restore balance` | ✅ Pass |
| Rollback Operations | `should fail when rolling back non-existent hold` | ✅ Pass |
| Asset Lifecycle | `should successfully create asset before issuing tokens` | ✅ Pass |
| Asset Lifecycle | `should handle multiple assets independently` | ✅ Pass |
| Zero Amount Tests | `should handle transfer of zero tokens` | ✅ Pass |
| Zero Amount Tests | `should handle hold of zero amount` | ✅ Pass |
| Wrong Actor Tests | `should fail when transferring from wrong account` | ✅ Pass |

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. Error Handling Issues

**Problem:** Server throws unhandled exceptions that Express converts to HTTP 500 responses.

**Affected Components:**
- `src/lib/routes/routes.ts` (route handlers)
- `src/app/services/inmemory/escrow.ts` (escrow operations)
- `src/app/services/inmemory/tokens.ts` (token operations)

**Solution Required:**
```typescript
// Current (BAD)
async function releaseOperation(req, res) {
  const result = await escrowService.release(req.body);
  res.json(result);
}

// Should be (GOOD)
async function releaseOperation(req, res) {
  try {
    const result = await escrowService.release(req.body);
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    res.json({
      error: { code: 4001, message: error.message },
      isCompleted: true,
      cid: req.body.operationId
    });
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Missing State Validation

**Problem:** No validation of operation state transitions.

**Missing Checks:**
- ✗ Operation ID exists before release/redeem/rollback
- ✗ Operation not already completed (double execution)
- ✗ Asset exists before operations
- ✗ Source actor owns the operation

**Solution Required:**
```typescript
// In escrow service
async release(request) {
  const hold = this.findHold(request.operationId);

  if (!hold) {
    throw new Error(`Hold not found: ${request.operationId}`);
  }

  if (hold.status === 'released') {
    throw new Error(`Hold already released: ${request.operationId}`);
  }

  if (hold.source !== request.source) {
    throw new Error(`Unauthorized: wrong source`);
  }

  // ... proceed with release
}
```

---

### 3. Idempotency Not Implemented

**Problem:** Same operation can be executed multiple times.

**Affected Operations:**
- Release
- Redeem
- Rollback

**Solution Required:**
- Track operation status (pending, released, redeemed, rolled back)
- Prevent state transitions from terminal states
- Return original result if operation already completed

---

## Recommended Fixes Priority

### Priority 1: Critical (Blocks testing)
1. **Add try-catch error handling** to all route handlers
2. **Return JSON error responses** instead of HTTP 500
3. **Validate operation ID exists** before release/redeem/rollback

### Priority 2: High (Security/Data integrity)
4. **Implement idempotency checks** for release/redeem/rollback
5. **Validate asset exists** before operations
6. **Validate operation ownership** (source actor matches)

### Priority 3: Medium (Edge cases)
7. **Handle partial releases** (or explicitly reject with error)
8. **Add operation state tracking** (pending → released/redeemed/rolled back)

---

## Server Implementation Gaps

Based on test failures, the following needs to be implemented:

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 4001,
    "message": "Hold operation not found"
  },
  "isCompleted": true,
  "cid": "operation-id-here"
}
```

### Required Validations
- [ ] Asset existence check before issue/transfer/redeem
- [ ] Hold existence check before release/redeem/rollback
- [ ] Operation ownership validation (source matches)
- [ ] Operation state validation (not already completed)
- [ ] Idempotency keys for all operations

### State Management
- [ ] Track hold status: `pending` → `released` | `redeemed` | `rolled_back`
- [ ] Prevent operations on completed holds
- [ ] Return meaningful errors for invalid state transitions

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Server Error Handling**
   - File: `src/lib/routes/routes.ts`
   - Add try-catch blocks to all route handlers
   - Return proper JSON error responses

2. **Add Validation Layer**
   - File: `src/app/services/inmemory/escrow.ts`
   - File: `src/app/services/inmemory/tokens.ts`
   - Implement pre-operation validation checks

3. **Implement State Management**
   - Track operation states in escrow service
   - Prevent duplicate operations

4. **Re-run Tests**
   - Verify all tests pass after fixes
   - Add additional edge case tests

## Test Coverage Summary

| Category | Total | Passed | Failed | Coverage |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Rollback Operations | 4 | 2 | 2 | 50% |
| Double Operation Prevention | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0% |
| Invalid Operation ID | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0% |
| Asset Lifecycle | 3 | 2 | 1 | 67% |
| Zero Amount Tests | 2 | 2 | 0 | 100% |
| Wrong Actor Tests | 2 | 1 | 1 | 50% |
| Partial Release | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0% |

**Overall Coverage:** 39% (7/18 tests passing)

---

## Conclusion

The test suite successfully identifies critical gaps in the server implementation:

1. **Error handling** is missing - server crashes instead of returning errors
2. **Validation** is insufficient - allows invalid operations
3. **State management** needs work - allows duplicate operations

These are **expected failures for a skeleton implementation** and provide a clear roadmap for what needs to be implemented to have a production-ready ledger adapter.
